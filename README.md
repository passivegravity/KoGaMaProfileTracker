# 📻 KoGaMa Profile Tracker 
Simple Python executable that spies on one chosen profile. 👻

Currently it has only ability to grab description, XP amount, and ranking.

⚠ I am not responsible for any punishment resulting from using this 'software'. 

⚠ It is only an educational project. 


# 📚 Setting up
This python executable requires modules like ``discord_webhook``, ``requests`` and ``beautifulsoup4``

You can either install each of them manually using ``pip install``  command in powershell, or by running setup.bat

To configure your script open it using any code editor and edit User ID in KoGaMa link and your own personal webhook.

# 📖 Usage

This script only monitors given profile when active / running.

I recommend aquiring some sort of Online GPU Hosting so that you can keep it running for longer periods of time.

There's plenty of free hosting websites but I'm not going to provide any example.

Simply keep it running in the background and wait for any notifications from webhook about made changes to profile.
